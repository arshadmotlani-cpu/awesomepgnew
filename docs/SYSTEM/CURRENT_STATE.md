## Current priority

1. **Stabilize vacating / checkout ops** — ensure `/admin/vacating` and [[Operations]] move-out queue work end-to-end after Date-serialization fix (`d4c01c6`).
2. **Approve pending move-outs** — e.g. residents with notice filed but not yet approved (Mohd Aatif scenario).
3. **Complete checkout settlements** — residents in `approved` + `awaiting_resident_details` / `refund_pending` (Harish scenario).
4. **Consolidate admin actions** — primary actions live in [[Operations]], [[Billing]], [[Vacating]], and checkout settlements; reduce duplicate entry points ([[DECISIONS#Operations as action hub]]).

## In progress

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Admin UX consolidation | Too many duplicate vacating/deposit/refund entry points across profile, bed map, overview — target: [[Operations]] + module hubs only |
| Obsidian second brain | This `/docs` knowledge base (initial creation 2026-06-21) |

---

## Upcoming work

- Auto-sync [[CHANGELOG]] via agent rule (documented in [[AI_CONTEXT]])
- Reduce legacy redirects (`/admin/requests`, `/admin/collections`, etc.) — see [[ROUTES#Legacy redirects]]
- Resident checkout settlement self-serve (meter + UPI) only after approve + vacate date — enforced in UI, verify all entry paths
- Optional: approve move-out inline from [[Operations]] queue without visiting `/admin/vacating`

## Known issues

See [[BUGS]] for full list. Highlights:

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `/admin/vacating` crash (Date serialization) | Critical | **Fixed** `d4c01c6` — await deploy |
| Lifecycle timeline scroll on Operations | Low | **Fixed** `d4c01c6` (ScrollToHash + resident map) |
| Vacating rows missing `customerId` in ops queue | Medium | **Fixed** `d4c01c6` |
| Timeline showed meter step before vacate date | Medium | **Fixed** `d4c01c6` (`vacatingJourney.ts`) |
| Bed map vs residents list assignment mismatch | Medium | **Fixed** `88a16e8` |

---

## Technical debt

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Duplicate vacating UIs | `/admin/vacating`, operations queue, resident profile, bed map, checkout settlements |
| Legacy routes | Many `/admin/*` paths redirect to canonical hubs |
| `listResidentsForAdmin` LIMIT 200 | May miss older vacated residents in ops timeline |
| Half-open range UX | Same-day checkout edge case documented in tests — admin must not shorten stay before completion |
| Master doc split | `AWESOME_PG_MASTER_DOCUMENTATION_V2.md` + this brain — keep cross-linked |
| Test coverage | Strong unit tests for billing/vacating math; fewer E2E for admin flows |
