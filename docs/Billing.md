## Purpose

Generate, track, and collect **monthly rent** and **electricity** charges for active residents. Support Razorpay auto-capture, UPI manual proof upload, late fees, pro-ration, and vacating checkout-month adjustments. All outstanding figures flow through [[DECISIONS#residentFinancialEngine as money SSOT]].

**New booking checkout (2026-06-23):** `bookingCheckoutTotals.ts` is the SSOT for “total to collect today” = new rent + deposit due − wallet credit + **prior stay outstanding** (`bookingPriorOutstanding.ts`). Payment splits new-booking rent/deposit first; remainder applies to prior deposit dues via append-only ledger rows.

**SSOT:** `rentInvoices.ts`, `billing.ts`, `electricityBilling.ts`, `meterElectricity.ts`, `residentFinancialEngine.ts`, `vacatingCheckoutBilling.ts`, `financialIntegrityAudit.ts`, `financialRepair.ts`

## Financial audit & reconciliation (2026-06-23)

Daily integrity scan across all customers — 8 checks (deposit shortfall, empty invoices, total mismatch, unreconciled payments, negative ledger, missing rent, duplicates, unsurfaced outstanding).

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `scripts/audit-financials.ts` | Read-only scan → `audit-output-{timestamp}.json` |
| `scripts/repair-financials.ts` | Auto-repair safe issues (`--dry-run` first) |
| `/api/cron/financial-reconciliation` | Daily cron (06:30 UTC) — audit + repair + action items |

See [[AUDIT_REPORT]] at repo root. Deposit ledger remains **append-only** — repairs INSERT corrective invoice rows only, never UPDATE/DELETE ledger entries.
